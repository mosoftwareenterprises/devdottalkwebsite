                    <p>Entrance: Kimmeridge House is a separate building on the campus, so walk around the paths until you find the building (Purple star on above map). We are upstairs. Look for the dev.talk sign.</p>
                    <p>Travel: A bus drops off at the Main Entrance (follow the blue line (once you get off the bus) to the purple star), there are lots of cycle routes too.</p>
                    <p>Parking: Car parks in the campus map above (blue star in map above), should be available to park at, and we are told they will be free at that time of day, but please check signage. Then follow the blue line on the map above to Kimmeridge House.</p>
                    <p>Disabled Access: The room is on the first floor and is accessible via a lift.</p>
                    <p>Refreshments: There will be soft drinks, and some biscuits available on the night. Please highlight to the organisers if there are any allergen issues.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>On arrival, your ticket will be checked, and you will be asked to fill in a name badge.</p>

                    <p>Note - There will be cameras recording and photographing the event, please highlight to the camera operator if you do not want to be included in any photos/videos. All photos/videos may be used in publicising future events, and be published to YouTube.</p>
