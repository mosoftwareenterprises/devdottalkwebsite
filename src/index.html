        <p>
          <b>{dev.talk}</b> (pronounced "dev dot talk") is a community-driven monthly meetup bringing together software engineers and tech professionals in the Bournemouth and Dorset area. </p>
        <p>Free to attend and run by community volunteers, we create an inclusive space where developers of all experience levels can learn, share knowledge, and connect. </p>
        <p> Each meetup features sessions from community members (mostly of a technical nature), with time for networking and discussions between talks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find a welcoming environment to explore new ideas and "geek out" with fellow tech enthusiasts. </p>
        <p> To extend our reach beyond the in-person events, all sessions (with speaker permission) are recorded and shared on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devdottalk" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>, creating an accessible resource for the wider developer community. </p>
        <p> Our mission is simple: build a thriving, supportive tech community in Dorset where everyone can grow professionally while making meaningful connections. </p>

        <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> was created by <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bio" target="_blank">Mark Oliver</a> in 2024. He saw that Bournemouth was lacking a software engineering based meetup despite being a <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bournemouth-Tech-Meetup-Rebirth" target="_blank">Tech Hub</a> on the South Coast of the UK, and as Wilton Knight once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzJszJ9MnA" target="_blank">"one person can make a difference"</a>, so Mark decided to create the meetup, and the community around it.</p>
