          <h1 id="welcome"><a href="/">Welcome to {dev.talk}</a></h1>
          <p>
            <b>{dev.talk}</b> (pronounced "dev dot talk") is a community-driven monthly meetup bringing together software engineers and tech professionals in the Bournemouth and Dorset area.
          </p>
          <p>Free to attend and run by community volunteers, we create an inclusive space where developers of all experience levels can learn, share knowledge, and connect. </p>
          <p> Each meetup features sessions from community members (mostly of a technical nature), with time for networking and discussions between talks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find a welcoming environment to explore new ideas and "geek out" with fellow tech enthusiasts. </p>
          <p> To extend our reach beyond the in-person events, all sessions (with speaker permission) are recorded and shared on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devdottalk" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>, creating an accessible resource for the wider developer community. </p>
          <p> Our mission is simple: build a thriving, supportive tech community in Dorset where everyone can grow professionally while making meaningful connections. </p>

              <p>This talk will introduce Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) — what they are, why they represent a promising software engineering solution, and where they are best applied. We will explore the kinds of problems that benefit most from DSLs and why developers and organizations should consider them. I will also share our real-world experiences applying DSLs in several domains: • Medical and veterinary practice • Data science and analytics • Legal documents and compliance These case studies will demonstrate how DSLs can simplify complexity, improve communication with domain experts, and deliver practical, impactful solutions across industries.</p>

I attended a specialist Maths School for my A-levels where I achieved A*s in Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science before starting a degree apprenticeship at a large American bank which I have just finished achieving a 1st class degree in Digital & Technology Solutions from the University of Exeter. Throughout the last 6 years, I have gone from being on a plane for the first time to having travelled to the USA for 2 weeks solo, to Japan for 2 weeks with friends. I've come out as Rose, struggled with my mental health and learnt a lot</p>

          <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> was created by <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bio" target="_blank">Mark Oliver</a> in 2024. He saw that Bournemouth was lacking a software engineering based meetup despite being a <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bournemouth-Tech-Meetup-Rebirth" target="_blank">Tech Hub</a> on the South Coast of the UK, and as Wilton Knight once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzJszJ9MnA" target="_blank">"one person can make a difference"</a>, so Mark decided to create the meetup, and the community around it.</p>
