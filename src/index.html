        <h1 id="welcome"><a href="/">Welcome to {dev.talk}</a></h1>
        <p>
          <b>{dev.talk}</b> (pronounced "dev dot talk") is a community-driven monthly meetup bringing together software engineers and tech professionals in the Bournemouth and Dorset area. </p>
        <p>Free to attend and run by community volunteers, we create an inclusive space where developers of all experience levels can learn, share knowledge, and connect. </p>
        <p> Each meetup features sessions from community members (mostly of a technical nature), with time for networking and discussions between talks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find a welcoming environment to explore new ideas and "geek out" with fellow tech enthusiasts. </p>
        <p> To extend our reach beyond the in-person events, all sessions (with speaker permission) are recorded and shared on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devdottalk" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>, creating an accessible resource for the wider developer community. </p>
        <p> Our mission is simple: build a thriving, supportive tech community in Dorset where everyone can grow professionally while making meaningful connections. </p>

            <li>Are your slides easy to read from far away?</li>
            <li>Slides with a Black background don't show up well to the audience or camera</li>
            <li>If you are adding Speaker Notes, make sure you can read them from far away (Font Size 20+)</li>

            <p><b>Level Up Your DevEx: Unit Test Complex E2E Flows + Integration Testing with Aspire & OTEL</b> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-poole-2782494a/" target="_blank">Andrew Poole</a></p>
            <p>             
This session is in two parts:
1) How to get the maximum mileage from a minimal number of tests - end-to-end component tests
2) Using .Net Aspire for next level devex and easy integration tests asserting against OTEL trace data
Part 1 Introduces, explains and demonstrates an approach to automated testing which covers as much of the surface area of your codebase as possible.Imagine a unit test where the 'unit' is actually multiple executables! A single test can cover the whole happy path flow of a complex piece of orchestration, from API handlers, service bus handlers, database calls etc all in-memory, fast and with a nice fluent developer experience!Because everything including the Program.cs and startup code are covered we can spot configuration and IoC issues which are hard to test with more traditional methods. I include a method of mocking and asserting against Azure Service Bus
Part 2 discusses the usual issues with integration tests and how they expose the issues with running an app locally. It then presents .Net Aspire as the answer to lots of these issues, It covers the process of adding .Net Aspire to a solution and showcases its features, adding additional OTEL telemetry to track interesting events, including persisting and rehydrating telemetry across any 'process airgaps' and the creation of integration tests covering end-to-end flows using Open Telemetry trace data for assertions.
The aim of both parts of this talk is to have a repo which when pulled down onto a fresh machine, builds first time, component tests pass first time, then having run the script and the app, the the integration tests pass first time, after which you can push F5 and have it all run with almost no time or effort!

        <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> was created by <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bio" target="_blank">Mark Oliver</a> in 2024. He saw that Bournemouth was lacking a software engineering based meetup despite being a <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bournemouth-Tech-Meetup-Rebirth" target="_blank">Tech Hub</a> on the South Coast of the UK, and as Wilton Knight once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzJszJ9MnA" target="_blank">"one person can make a difference"</a>, so Mark decided to create the meetup, and the community around it.</p>
