# Welcome to the March 2026 {dev.talk} Meetup

## The One Where JARVIS Fits in Your Pocket and the IC Grows Up

Hi there,

This month we are taking a delve into the world of AI to talk about building an Agentic Mobile OS and also learning how being a manager can make you a better engineer.

Thank you for being part of our amazing community of software engineers and tech enthusiasts.

**Quick Reminder:** Organising these events takes a lot of time and effort from our dedicated volunteers. If your plans change and you can't make it, please cancel your ticket via the ticketing app or drop us an email at [contactus@devdottalk.uk](mailto:contactus@devdottalk.uk).This helps us manage the event better and allows others to attend.

#### Building Agentic Mobile OS for privacy

I'll be sharing my journey of building JarvisOS; a privacy-first mobile operating system that keeps AI local on your device.
The talk will walk through how I got here: starting with learning how AI systems remember and retrieve information (RAG), understanding how computers can find similar pieces of data quickly (vector databases), and diving into Android's deep internals to make it all work at the system level.
I'll then introduce JarvisOS itself - what we're building, why it's different from existing solutions, and how we're using Cactus (a lightweight AI framework) to make powerful AI run entirely on your phone without sending anything to the cloud.
We'll wrap up with a practical demonstration: a live notebook showing how AI models get compressed to fit on mobile devices - taking something that normally requires massive servers and making it work in your pocket.

#### Speaker Bio

Kevin is a recent Data Science and AI Graduate with a passion for building intelligent systems, primarily with Python. A multiple hackathon winner, he considers himself an AI Engineer at heart, with a strong foundation in both software engineering and data Science. Still exploring where to specialise, Kevin is driven by curiosity and a love for community, most recently volunteering at the Reconnect conference through the Sam and Ray podcast.

#### How becoming a manager made me a better engineer

In the last 5 years, I have transitioned from an individual contributor, to a manager of an engineering team with increasingly more reports and more responsibility.

In this talk, I'll guide through what this journey has taught be about management, but also what it has taught be about being a better engineer.

Topics include: management styles and traps, prioritisation, estimation and time management, recruitment (and being recruited), and staying mentally healthy.

#### Speaker Bio

Engineering Manager specialising in web and backend systems, building high-performing, people-first teams with strong commercial focus. Active in the PHP community, I’ve organised initiatives, spoken at conferences, and lead digital delivery for a charity festival that has raised over £850,000.
