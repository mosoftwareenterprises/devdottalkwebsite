            <h4>Why websites become hard to change - and how to stop it.</h4>
            <p>
                Many teams struggle to evolve their platforms without increasing cost, complexity, or upgrade risk.
                Monolithic systems can become hard to change, while micro-services are often too heavy for most
                organisations.

                This session introduces the Feature Isolation Pattern — a practical way to keep a stable core platform
                (such as Magento or WordPress) while building customer-facing features that can be developed, tested,
                and deployed independently.

                Using real examples, the talk shows how this approach improves flexibility, performance, and long-term
                maintainability without rebuilding the platform or adopting full micro-services.
            </p>

            <h4>The AI Integration Framework: When to Automate, When to Wait</h4>

            <p>
                Do you have broken processes that needs fixing? Have you hired expensive consultants who have told you
                that AI is a magical wand that will fix everything for you? You are not alone in this scam.
                In this session, you'll gain a practical decision framework to cut through the AI hype and make
                strategic automation choices for your business. Rather than focusing on what AI can do, we'll explore
                when it should be used versus traditional automation tools.
            </p>
