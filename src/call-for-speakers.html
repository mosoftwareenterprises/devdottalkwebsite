                <li>Google Slides is simple to use and free.</li>
                <li>Exporting from powerpoint and importing to Google Slides can remove animations.</li>
                <li>If you are doing live code demos, think about how you can deal with no internet access (e.g.
                    pre-recorded gif or
                    something like demotime)</li>
                <li>Are your slides easy to read from far away?</li>
                <li>Slides with a Black background don't show up well to the audience or camera</li>
                <li>If you are adding Speaker Notes, make sure you can read them from far away (Font Size 20+)</li>
